# Contributing to the Ecosystem

Don't forget, ***code is not the only currency*** when it comes to an open source community. There are ways you can contribute to a project without directly submitting a PR.

* Contribute tools, modules, etc.
* Publish quick start templates
* Provide answers on StackOverflow
* Participate in community channels
* Write blogs and speak about the project
