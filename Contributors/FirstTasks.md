# Good First Tasks and Help Wanted

Maintainers and other contributors sometimes label issues as `Good First Task` or `Help Wanted`, as a way of signaling to the community that this may be a good work item for a new contributor to take on.

Tackling these issues are a good way to build trust with committers and maintainers on the project, and can be a good way to dry run the PR process for a given project before you try to contribute a mission critical bug fix or feature.
