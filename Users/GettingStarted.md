# Getting Started on an OSS Project

**Stop:** Before you install that OSS library into your development branch for the first time, read the documentation *in the repo*. This is a great opportunity to be a contributor.

Remember, ***code is not the only currency***, fixing documentation is an incredibly valuable contribution.

## Testing the docs

- [ ] Follow the installation instructions
- [ ] Use build scripts
- [ ] Run sample code
- [ ] Deploy cloud resources (e.g., Azure Deploy button)
